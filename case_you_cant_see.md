# The Case You Can't See Case Study

## The Deal

Law enforcement occupies a critical---and fraught---position in modern American society. Rates of suicide and addiction far outpace the general populace, yet traditional courses of treatment are less accessible and effective. This Special Place ("TSP", a pseudonym) envisioned a radically different model of care delivery: an inpatient, first-responders-only recovery program. The idea took off like a shot, and after a fairly rudimentary website and brand were developed, they got busy treating patients. And they were good at it. So when they came to us, a few years later, their website still looked like it was hosted on Geocities---but that had never really been a blocker...until now. The business had grown, the old site was holding them back, and they were ready to re-present themselves to the world. Which raised a question: how can we best present ourselves? It was a rare opportunity to get deep and articulate who we are and what we do. It was time to talk to users.

## The Assignment

That was a wake-up call: it was time to professionalize their image and marketing. They'd learned and changed the product itself quite a bit since the initial idea that was reflected in the website, as well as having added their first outpatient facility and plans for several more facilities. Our brief was a bit unusual for a product development firm: we came in to build a marketing website. In the process, we helped them rediscover and better understand TSP as a product.

The Problem
-----------

Usually, the first thing we'd do is interview users. Can't do that here: the nature of recovery work precludes it, for practical and privacy reasons. Secondly: First Responders (cops, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) won't talk to outsiders the same way they'll talk to their tribe. Especially about vulnerability. What could we do?

Our initial point-of-contact was Barry, their Admissions Director. He functioned as a COO and right-hand to the CEO, but his real job was to get on the phone, at a moment's notice, with a firefighter or cop on their worst day and convince them to check themselves in. Barry was grizzled, no-BS, and knew the domain well---but he was no first responder himself. He was, however, an addict in recovery.

"First Responder" is a bit of a euphemism: almost all of the time, that meant "cop". Modern addiction treatment is based on the Alcoholics Anonymous model. To recover, addicts must acknowledge they've lost control, and ask for help. This is tricky for cops: those two things can kill you on the job. So how could we help them bridge that distance?

EXERCISE 1: Write down three ideas for bridging that gap

EXERCISE 2: Write down three ways you might validate those ideas

One thing TSP learned was that the bonds between the in-patient Residents were a critical factor in recovery. Regardless of addiction, police culture is strongly based on an insider-outsider group model. The key to getting them in the door was to earn their trust...but we were the outside group. How could we speak to them?

We'd started with access to Barry, their Admissions Director. Soon we were introduced to Darlene, the Executive Director and Ambassador.

"Ambassador"? To whom?

Turns out there's a whole 'nother class of users: "Peer Support". Because of the rigors of the job, social stigma, and cultural norms, it's not always easy for First Responders to seek counseling when they hit a rough patch. Peer Support are special resources, including fellow first responders specially trained as counselors, and made available to their team. Imagine a flyer on the break-room bulletin board: ".Â ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vpmMvltJ_GYqq1ISUURgHpRYKB1hdjLWvr3d111GvAAnvwh3kHt57e1p5wPMvPSGyBrsoVIWFI2xVLsVQvdOQE0Z1TL2N9nPKSi_-kYk9MpnNKTsAK2A2V5FE5LWtr-i0umm0djX)

When a cop is, say, drinking too much, he knows a fellow cop, trained as Peer Support, is there in the department to help. Darlene's role was primarily to interface with the various departments, meet their Peer Support teams, and let them know about TSP.

EXERCISE 3: What are three things you'd want to learn from Darlene.

It was in talking to Darlene that we learned about another critical user: the Spouse. First responders know what institutional living looks like: cots, mess halls, the works---and TSP doesn't look like institutional living. It looks like a spa. It's a ranch out in the woods, and there are all sorts of activities and therapies out there. When first responders are drying out, it helps to be away from the temptations of bars and their usual, destructive routines. So TSP offers a calm respite, a lake to fish on, trails to hike, animal therapy, the works.

So when, say, a cop goes on a bender, has his worst day ever, gets fired, and just barely marshalls the courage to ask for help, what might his wife say?

"No WAY you're going to that place! It looks like a vacation!!"

EXERCISE 4: What are three ways to address the Spouse concerns, while still serving the primary user

So we've talked a bunch, but let's make sure we really address the primary user: a First Responder in need of Recovery. Usually (but not always!) this means a male cop on booze. We need to get them to put down the bottle and pick up the phone. We need them to check themselves in. We need them to overcome the cultural bias among cops that "therapy is for the weak" and they don't talk about their feelings. Many addicts relapse; for those First Responders who've already tried recovery---and are in need of help again---we need to give them confidence that TSP is different.

EXERCISE 5: Spend no more than 45m designing this product, using whichever tools you're most comfortable with. It could be a website, a brochure, or a communication strategy. It could be a working squarespace site or a sharpie sketch.
